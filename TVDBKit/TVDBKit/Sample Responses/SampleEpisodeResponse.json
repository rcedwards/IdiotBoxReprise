But Jack and Ben had to convince them to return to the island in order to save those left behind. Upon returning, Jack, Kate, Hurley and Sayid were reunited with their fellow survivors – but found themselves in 1977 Dharma times. But Sun and Ben were not transported back to the ‘70s. They landed back on the island in present time and discovered the fate of the other members. As for those left behind on the island after the Oceanic 6 departed, violent shifts through time were wreaking havoc on their lives. After Locke left the island under the guise of Jeremy Bentham to contact the 6, his actions helped end the time rifts, which left the survivors to fend for themselves in ‘70s Dharmaville. But Locke was murdered at the hands of Ben, who insisted on taking the body back to the island. Upon awakening after crash landing back on the isle, Ben discovered that Locke was very much alive. What are Locke’s intentions now that he has returned and re-claimed his position as leader of “The Others?” And will Jack's decision to put a plan in action in order to set things right on the island be met with open arms or resistance by those close to him?
