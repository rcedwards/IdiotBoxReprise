Two years of searching the film vaults has turned up thousands of feet of unseen film footage. Steve Sabol, the host of Lost Treasures of NFL Films, foolishly thought he could produce one 60-minute documentary covering the whole history of NFL Films.  In fact, enough material was unearthed to cover five programs, all on the 1960s.  And it just expanded from there.  In addition to the five-part reflection of NFL Films' beginnings in the 1960s, Lost Treasures of NFL Films unearthed footage of minor-league football, TV football analysts, training camps, and much more.  The result totaled 22 episodes spanning four decades, airing on ESPN",

Travelling across the globe, archaeologists and scholars separate fact from myth, while a team of forensic anthropologists and artists put flesh on bone, using both traditional and state-of-the-art methods of facial reconstruction. An engaging narrative develops around each skull as the experts assemble clues to rebuild not only a face, but the life and times of a bygone era.  Stepping into the past viewers will finally come face to face with some of the most legendary characters of the Bible. A theological journey not to be missed, by any measure.",

      "overview": "\"In the beginning was Napoleon!\", a popular saying among many historians which demonstrates the extent of Napoleon's political and creative power. It also suggests that this man still has great relevance today. Most of us don't know, that many things we take for granted in everyday life were introduced by Napoleon. From the metric system to massive road construction projects, from the shape of the young United States to the roots of modern European legislation Napoleon's achievements live on. \r\n\r\nLife Under Napoleon shows Napoleon's rise and fall exclusively from the point of view of the citizens of his time, including blacksmiths, soldiers, farmers, dissidents and housewives. In four episodes, we examine what life was like in Europe from 1799 until 1815, from the end of the French Revolution until Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig 1813 and Waterloo 1815, while keeping a global perspective in mind. \r\n\r\nThe central parts of each episode are first hand accounts of life changing events, based on authentic historical material, often surprising anecdotes that happened under Napoleon's reign. Our sources are diaries, letters and court documents. These don't speak of politics and alliances but about blood and tears, tyranny and hunger, about joy and freedom, and so does Life under Napoleon.",

In 1913, young Richard Herncastle, played by Colin Firth, escapes from a stuffy, provincial English background into the glitter and excitement of the theatre world. Funny, sad, and nostalgic, Lost Empires, follows Richard from his naïve, country upbringing to join his uncle Nick Ollanton, a famous music hall illusionist - known as the Indian Magician, Ganga Dun. The mystery of illusions, on and off the stage, is eventually shattered for Richard, whose dream of becoming a famous painter becomes sidetracked while he contends with men gone nearly insane, the lusts of countless women, and a murder that hangs over his head.",
